description: Generate a concise PRD from a feature description.
---
Generate a PRD from the user request.

Write to `.plans/prd.md`:

1. Problem - what pain this addresses (2-3 sentences)
2. Solution - what is being built (1 paragraph)
3. Requirements - numbered must-haves
4. Non-goals - what is intentionally out of scope
5. Technical constraints - from immutable rules and architecture
6. Acceptance criteria - testable done statements

Keep it under 60 lines. Stop after writing the PRD.
